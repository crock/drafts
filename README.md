# Drafts Script Library

`drafts.js` includes a set of functions that enable working with the Drafts app in a more functional manner. 

[Ramda](https://ramdajs.com/) is included for general-purpose functional programming, along with several files for experimenting with React development within Drafts.

The easies way to use this set of scripts with Drafts is to install Working Copy on iOS and use the [File Sync](https://workingcopyapp.com/manual/files-sync) method to clone this repo locally and sync with Drafts' script library folder: `iCloud/Drafts/Library/Scripts`
